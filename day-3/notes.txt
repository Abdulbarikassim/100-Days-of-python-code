CHALLENGE : SNAKE GAME.

CHALLENGE : SNAKE  GAME.
What we are going to make a the end of the day:
Break the problem into small solvable pieces:  
  1. Create a snake body.
  2.Move the snake.
  3.control the snake. 
  4.Detect collision with food.
  5.create a score board.
  6.Detect collision with wall. 
  7.Detect collision with tail.

Range function:
  In python range() function typically take three integer inputs:
    1.start: This is the starting value of the sequence.
    2.stop: This is the ending value of the sequence.it defines where the sequence ends.
    3.step: This is the amount by which the sequence advances form one elements to the next.

    The general syntax of the `range()` function is as follows: 
      range(start ,stop,step)

Here are some notes for your Snake class:

1. Initialization:
    - The `__init__` method initializes the Snake object.
    - It initializes the `segments` list to store the Turtle objects
      representing the snake's body segments.
    - It calls the `create_snake` method to create the initial segments of the snake.

2. Creating the Snake:
    - The `create_snake` method creates the initial segments of the snake.
    - It iterates over the `STARTING_POSITIONS` list to determine the positions of the segments.
    - For each position, it creates a new Turtle object with a square shape, white color, and places it at the specified position.
    - It adds each newly created segment to the `segments` list.

3. Moving the Snake:
    - The `move` method moves the snake forward by one step.
    - It iterates over the segments of the snake in reverse order (from the last segment to the first).
    - For each segment (except the first one), it sets its position to the position of the preceding segment.
    - Then, it moves the first segment (head) forward by `MOVE_DISTANCE` units.

4.Controlling the movement of the snake : 
  If we want to control the snake using the keyboard we use function from Turtle:
  `onkey-method` which takes two input the function and the keyword.

  we have to create four method :
  set-heading of the methods according to the direction.  
  1.Up : 
    use the set-heading method in (90).
  2.Down :
    use the set-heading(270)
  3.Right : 
    use the set-heading(90)
  4.Left :
    use the set-heading(0)
