# 100-Days-of-Python-Code

Welcome to my "100 Days of Python Code" repository! 🐍

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing Python programming over the course of 100 days. Each day, I will be committing code related to various Python concepts, projects, exercises, and challenges.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Python Code" challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. It's a great way to build consistency, improve programming skills, and work on personal projects.

Throughout this challenge, I'll be exploring a wide range of topics, including:

- Basic Python syntax and data types
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- File handling and data manipulation
- Web development with Flask or Django
- Data analysis and visualization with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib

✔️My main aim and focus in this challenge is to have a problem solving skills to go Up and think like 
a programmer.

## Repository Structure
Name of the challenge e.g Snake game, Pong game , racing Game.structure:
├── Snake game/
│ └── main.py
│ └──player.py
│ └──scoreboard.py



Each day's code will be organized into its respective directory (`name of the project.`). Within each day's directory, you'll find Python scripts, projects, exercises, or any related files.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code and projects shared in this repository. If you're new to Python or programming in general, you can use this repository as a learning resource. If you're already familiar with Python, you might find interesting projects or challenges to expand your knowledge.

To get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific day's directory to view the code.
3. Run the Python scripts or projects using your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the creators of the "100 Days of Code" challenge for inspiring this journey, as well as to the Python community for its wealth of resources and support.

Happy coding! 😊🚀
